#. L10n: square brackets [] denote buttons. This is a bit of word play meaning that Furkot makes booking hotels as easy as pressing Next button repeatedly until the only thing left to do is to press "Done". If translation cannot reflect this word play, a sentence meaning that booking is easy is acceptable. Either button or both can be dropped.
msgid "All you need to do is to keep pressing [Next] until you are [Done]."
