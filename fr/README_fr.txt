Common words:
* see glossary.po

Other:
* Use of "indicatif" / "impératif" are sometimes not consistent (e.g. "Cliquer" / "Cliquez"). "Impératif" should be preferred for actions, but some verbs are not common in "impératif" for UIs (e.g. "Voir les ..." is more common than "Voyez les ...". Could deserve a dedicated review.
